# Pixel to Print Calculator
=====

This is my first self-initiated project. It is a small web application that determines pixel requirements in relationship to print resolution, and visa-versa. 

This project was created primarily to help me utilize new skills that I have been learning as I teach myself to code. 

## Languages practiced:
-----

-HTML
-CSS
-SCSS
..-Bourbon, Neat
-JavaScript
..-jQuery
..—jQuery Plugins (Animsition, Clearing form fields)
-Git
-GitHub Flavored Markdown

## Other skills:
-----
-Used Atom for the first time.
-Familiarized myself with GitHub, and using Version Control practices.
-Experimented with using SMACSS to organize my project
-Used Git and SCSS via the Console.
-Styled form elements with CSS (learned what I can and can't do)
-Used image sprites as background-images
-Used JavaScript and non-breaking space to prevent orphans

## Issues:
-----
-I couldn’t figure out how to get the form to recalculate after an error message without refreshing the page.
