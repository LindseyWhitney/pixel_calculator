# Pixel to Print Calculator

This is my first self-initiated project. It is a small web application that determines pixel requirements in relationship to print resolution, and visa-versa.

This project was created primarily to help me utilize new skills that I have been learning as I teach myself to code.

## Languages practiced:
* HTML
* CSS
* SCSS
  * Bourbon, Neat
* JavaScript
  * jQuery
    * jQuery Plugins (Animsition, Clearing form fields)
* Git
* GitHub Flavored Markdown

## Other skills:
* Used Atom for the first time.
* Familiarized myself with GitHub, and using Version Control practices.
* Used media queries to facilitate responsive design.
* Experimented with using SMACSS to organize my project
* Used Git and SCSS via the Console.
* Styled form elements with CSS (learned what I can and can't do)
* Used image sprites as background-images
* Used JavaScript and non-breaking space to prevent orphans

## Issues:
* I couldnâ€™t figure out how to get the form to recalculate after an error message without refreshing the page.
* It seems like the calculations don't work if the entered number has a comma in it.
