This is my first self-initiated project. It is a small web application that determines pixel requirements in relationship to print resolution, and visa-versa. 

This project was created primarily to help me utilize new skills that I have been learning as I teach myself to code. It allowed me to put the following new skills to use:
HTML
CSS
SCSS
Bourbon, Neat
JavaScript
jQuery
jQuery Plugins (Animsition)
Git
GitHub 
The Console
Atom
RegEx

I also learned a few particular skills:
How to use non-breaking space to prevent orphans
Using image sprites as background-images
How to style form elements with CSS (what I can and can't do)
That Stack Overflow is awesome
